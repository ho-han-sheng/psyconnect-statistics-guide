# Psyconnect Statistics Guide
A common aversion faced by psychology undergraduates is the compulsory requirement of statistics in most degree programs. Many individuals stop formal education in mathematics after their secondary education, most of which would never interact with academic mathematics till university. This is further exacerbated when working adults (a large portion of SUSS' student population) decide to pursue university education in their journey of self-improvement and lifelong learning. 

Given the fast-paced and rigourous nature of university modules, many part-time psychology students may face exceptional difficulties in keeping up with mathematics professors and other mathematically-inclined majors. This guide seeks to help bridge the gap by providing a consolidated guide for most of the "assumed knowledge" that is required to efficiently grasp material. By focusing on more elaboration and less technical speak, this book would help provide psychology majors, mature students and those who just need a refresher, a smooth transition towards tackling their ~~fun~~ statistics modules.
