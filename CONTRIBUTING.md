# Contributing to PsyConnect Statistics Guide
We love your input! We want to make contributing to this project as easy and transparent as possible, whether it's:

- Reporting a bug
- Discussing the current state of the code
- Submitting a fix
- Proposing new features
- Becoming a maintainer

## We develop with Github
We use github to host code, to track issues and feature requests, as well as accept pull requests.

## We Use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html), So All Code Changes Happen Through Pull Requests
Pull requests are the best way to propose changes to the codebase (we use [Github Flow](https://guides.github.com/introduction/flow/index.html)). We actively welcome your pull requests:

1. Fork the repo and create your branch from `master`.
2. Test your code. Ensure that the PDF can be compiled.
3. Are there any errors that pop up? Resolve them first.
4. Issue that pull request!

## Any contributions you make will be under the GPL 3.0 license
In short, when you submit code changes, your submissions are understood to be under the same [GPL License](https://choosealicense.com/licenses/gpl-3.0/) that covers the project. Feel free to contact the maintainers if that's a concern.

## Report bugs using Github's [issues](https://github.com/ho-han-sheng/psyconnect-statistics-guide/issues)
We use GitHub issues to track public bugs. Report a bug by [opening a new issue](https://github.com/ho-han-sheng/psyconnect-statistics-guide/issues/new/choose); it's that easy!

## Write bug reports with detail, background, and sample code

**Great bug reports** tend to have:

- A quick summary and/or background
- Steps to reproduce
  - Be specific!
  - Give sample code if you can. 
- What you expected would happen
- What actually happens
- Notes (possibly including why you think this might be happening, or stuff you tried that didn't work)

## Use a consistent coding style
Follow the code styleguide (when it comes out...)

## License

## Code of conduct
